        <p style="color: brown;">The "paragraph hamburger" is a writing organizer that visually outlines the key
            components of a paragraph.
            Topic sentence, detail sentences, and a closing sentence are the main elements of a good paragraph, and each
            one forms a different "piece" of the hamburger</p>

                <p>The original and for many still the best. So good, in fact, that Ren√© Redzepi, of Copenhagen's Noma,
                    the
                    number one restaurant on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, has committed fully to his own
                    pandemic
                    era-inspired burger joint Popl. The history of the hamburger is contested, and some say it goes back
                    to
                    ancient Rome, but one theory about the invention of the modern hamburger is that it can be ascribed
                    to
                    Charlie Nagreen, later known as 'Hamburger Charlie', who in 1885 squashed a beef meatball between
                    slices
                    of bread so his customers could walk around eating</p>

                    <h3 style="color: brown;">TurkeyBurger</h3>
                    <p>Probably inspired by one of the greatest sandwiches of all time - the leftover turkey sandwich -
                        this
                        is a burger that might not be everyone's first choice, but should definitely be one all burger
                        lovers get to know. Turkey is a delicious, tasty and dry meat that is packed full of flavour,
                        making
                        it a perfect alternative to red meat for a burger patty. Try this recipe and never look back.

                    <h3 style="color: brown;">Portobello mushroom burger</h3>
                    <p>Substituting the meat patty for a delicious, meaty, umami-packed grilled portobello mushroom will
                        give you a vegan burger that will satisfy even the hungriest carnivore. Add mango and
                        beansprouts
                        for a fresh contrast of texture and flavour. </p>
